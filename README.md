**Student Grade Management**

This project is a Student Grade Management system that models students, grades, and module registrations.
It provides functionality to manage and compute student data such as personal information, average grades, and the modules they are registered for.
This project includes Student, Grade, Module and Registration classes and was developed using TDD.

This is being developed as coursework for my second year at rhul in the Software Engineering module.
